According to the legend about Mireuk and Yukjomun, the village was formed before the Goryeo Dynasty, and the Seolheulsan Bongsudae, which is believed to have been used during the Imjin War, which occurred 400 years ago, has already been inhabited by people in groups from before that time. is proving The old name of the village was Gancheon (Êàô¹), but in the middle of the Joseon Dynasty, it was changed to Gacheon (Ê¥ô¹) to the present day. One day, a farmer worked in the paddy field all day, and before the sun went down and went home, he counted his paddy field and found that there was no rice. The story that I counted several times, but could not find it, gave up and picked up the hat that I had taken off to return home, and the story that there was a bowl under the hat is an allegorical expression of the harsh life of the people of Namhae who cultivated even a small land into rice fields. .

Starting with the main statue of Buddha in the center, on the left side is a statue of a bodhisattva standing upright facing the front and holding a woman¡¯s wit, and on the right side, standing in the same posture as the left side bodhisattva, holding a lotus branch. A supporting statue of a bodhisattva is placed.The main Buddha statue in the center is a mouth Buddha standing on a lotus seat with his bare shoulders lowered, his left hand raised to the front of his chest, and his feet spread to the left and right. Small eyes, nose, and mouth are depicted in the figure, and the face with a rigid expression that does not show a smile is a typical stylistic feature mainly seen in Buddhist paintings since the late 18th century, along with angled shoulders raised horizontally.Judging from the fact that the left side of the bodhisattva is wearing a shroud and holding a woman's will, it is presumed that it is the left side poem of the Buddha Sakyamuni, Munsu Bodhisattva. The shoulders are narrow compared to the size of the head and the feet feel atrophied, but the overall stability seems to be due to the long, thick hem of the robe flowing down the arm. The expression of the right-sided bodhisattva is similar to that of the left-sided bodhisattva. At the bottom of the picture, a firearm remains.This gwaebultang not only shows the typical discord since the mid-18th century in the shape, expression, and body proportions of the figure, but also shows a harmonious and sophisticated expression technique that seems to be rigid. ."
